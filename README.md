# eatigo! - Food Ordering & Delivery Website

* This website was built so that customers can easily browse all the dishes the  restaurant has available, customize dishes to their requirements and place an order.  Also considering the recent pandemic situations most people will prefer ordering  food online rather than stepping out of their houses.

* From the restaurants perspective, they no longer spend time taking the customers order, stop worrying about communication errors and streamline their order management workflow. The admin application provides ease for restaurant owners.


## Walkthrough:

### User section:
* First the user must create an account before logging in the portal. If user already has an account then the user just has to login with correct credentials.
